<h3> Hi its me KIRK! </h3>

<h1> KIRK GILBERT BERNABE </h1>

<p> Hi just to let you know guys. I just finished my studies a few months ago and still waiting for the graduation rites. For now i am self studying, searching, experimenting stuffs to improve my self. I really wanted to be a good Developer so i can build applications or website that not just for fun but also to be fit in the corporate world. </p>

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning different stuffs. I am new to Github and also still learning different frameworks. </br>
 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project which is a desktop application that will be built using electronJS </br>
 âš¡ Fun fact: I hate coding in the past but when i started college i realized that it was fun building everything like it was no limit at all.
